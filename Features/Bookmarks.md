Add a note to your bookmarks by clicking on the bookmark icon in the [[Panel]] on the right side. All your bookmarks are shown in the sidebar to easily access them.

The bookmarks are stored on your device and are not synced with other devices. If you delete a note that is in your bookmarks, it will be removed from your bookmarks automatically.
