# Color schemes

Eleventy Notes supports a few different color schemes to choose from. You can change the color scheme by adding a `theme` object to your `app.json` file:

```json
// /app.json
{
  "theme": {
    "color": "indigo"
  }
}
```

The supported color schemes are: tomato, red, crimson, pink, plum, purple, violet, indigo, blue, sky, cyan, teal, mint, green, grass, lime, yellow, amber, orange and brown.

# Light and dark themes

All color schemes come in a light theme and dark theme. You can switch between them by clicking one of the three button in the header:

- Light Theme
- Dark Theme
- System Theme

The system theme uses the appearance of your operating system. Your OS may use a light theme or a dark theme depending on the time of day.
