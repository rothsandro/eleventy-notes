**to be released**

- ✨ **Redesign**: The design of the header, search, navigation and panel has been improved.

## Version 0.23.2

**April 14, 2024**

- 🐛 **Fixed renderAsList**: The `renderAsList` filter now works with the tags collection by default. Previously, you had to configure the `titleProp`. This is no longer necessary.

## Version 0.23.1

**March 25, 2024**

- 🐛 **Fixed asset handling**: Images should now work again in production.

## Version 0.23.0

**March 09, 2024**

- ✨ **Enhanced Sidebar Config**: The sidebar configuration now boasts increased flexibility and power. It allows the definition of multiple sections and the use of queries to filter and sort your notes.
- 💥 **Updated Sidebar Config**: The configuration for your notes' sidebar has been revamped and necessitates manual migration.
  - The `sidebar.notes` property has been superseded by the `sidebar.sections` property, enabling the configuration of one or more sections.
  - Each group now accommodates a `query` property, which supersedes `pattern`, `tags`, and `tree`. A new `createNotesQuery()` function is available, generating a query based on these three properties.

If you've customized your sidebar configuration, please migrate it to the new format. Don't hesitate to reach out if you require assistance with the migration. Below is an example of the **previous** format, which defines two groups in the sidebar using a pattern and tags filter:

```js
// /app.js
const { defineConfig } = require("./.app/app-config");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  sidebar: {
    notes: [
      {
        label: "My Posts",
        pattern: "/posts/",
      },
      {
        label: "Drafts",
        expanded: false,
        tags: ["draft"],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

Below is the equivalent configuration in the **updated** format. The two groups are now encapsulated within a new section titled _Notes_. The `createNotesQuery()` function, which needs to be imported at the beginning of the file, is now responsible for filtering.

```js
// /app.js
const { defineConfig, createNotesQuery } = require("./.app/app-config");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  sidebar: {
    sections: [
      {
        label: "Notes",
        groups: [
          {
            label: "My Posts",
            query: createNotesQuery({
              pattern: "/posts/",
            }),
          },
          {
            label: "Drafts",
            expanded: false,
            query: createNotesQuery({
              tags: ["draft"],
            }),
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Version 0.22.0

**February 03, 2024**

- ✨ **Callouts**: You can now add callouts to your notes.

## Version 0.21.0

**January 20, 2024**

- ✨ **Custom CSS**: You can now add custom CSS to your site.

## Version 0.20.0

**January 13, 2024**

- ✨ **Language**: The content language can now be configured in the config file.
- ⚡️ **Performance**: Building the site is now faster (dev mode and production build).

## Version 0.19.0

**December 26, 2023**

- ✨ **Anchor Wikilinks**: Wikilinks can now link to a heading, e.g. `[[#My Heading]]`.
- ✨ **URL Prefix**: The url prefix `/n` can now be configured via configuration file.
- ✨ **Improved search**: It now includes an excerpt and highlights the search term.
- ⚡️ **Performance**: Rebuilding the site after a change when running in development mode is now faster.
- 💥 **Removed notes page**: The notes page `/n` has been removed. We think the flat list of all notes
  was not very useful for most users as it did not provide any context (e.g. in which folder the note is located).
  A properly configured sidebar, the tags pages and the search are much more useful for navigating your notes.
  You can create your own notes page if you still want to have one.
- 💥 **New configuration file**: The previous JSON configuration `app.json` has been replaced with a JavaScript configuration `app.js`.
  If you have an existing configuration, you need to migrate it to the new format. Rename the file to `app.js` and replace the content with the following:

  ```js
  const { defineConfig } = require(".app/app-config");

  module.exports = defineConfig({
    // Put your existing configuration here, e.g.
    title: "My Notes",
  });
  ```

  If you've used the `$schema` property, you can remove it and instead add a `// @ts-check` comment at the top of the file.
