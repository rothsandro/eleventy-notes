tags: organizing
---

You can use tags to organize your notes. All your tags are automatically listed in the sidebar and there is a separate tags page that lists all your tags and notes. In addition, the [[Features/Search|Search]] support filtering by tags, and you can customize the [[Features/Sidebar|Sidebar]] based on tags.

## Adding tags

Use Front Matter to add tags to your notes. For a single tag you can directly add the tag name:

```markdown
---
tags: example
---

My note
```

For multiple tags, you can either use a list or the `[]` syntax:

```markdown
---
tags:
  - one
  - two
  - three
---

My note
```

```markdown
---
tags: [one, two, three]
---

My note
```

## Tags mapping

You can customize the visible label of a tag by adding a mapping in the [[Configuration file]].

```json
// /app.json
{
  "tags": {
    "map": {
      // Map a tag to a different label
      "books": "üìö Books",

      // Map a tag to a different label with a custom URL slug
      "books": {
        "label": "üìö Books & Articles",
        "slug": "books"
      },

      // If a tag consists of emojis only, you must provide a mapping for it.
      "‚≠ê": "‚≠ê Favorites"
    }
  }
}
```
